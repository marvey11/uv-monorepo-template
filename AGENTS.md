## Repository scope

This repository is a Python monorepo managed by uv. Applications live under `apps/`, reusable libraries live under `libs/`, and each workspace member is an independent Python package with a `src/` layout.

The root project is tooling-only. Do not add application code or make the root package installable unless the repository design changes intentionally.

## Development workflow

- Use Python 3.12 or newer, as specified by `.python-version` and the project metadata.
- Run `uv sync` after changing project metadata or the lockfile.
- Keep `uv.lock` committed and up to date.
- Run `uv run --all-packages ruff check .`, `uv run --all-packages ruff format --check .`, `uv run --all-packages mypy .`, and `uv run --all-packages pytest` before submitting changes.
- Prefer `uv run --package <member> ...` when checking one workspace member.
- Format with Ruff and keep imports absolute.

## Workspace dependencies

- Add internal dependencies to the consuming member's `[project] dependencies`.
- Add the matching `[tool.uv.sources]` entry with `workspace = true`.
- Add third-party dependencies with uv rather than editing `uv.lock` by hand.

## Testing

Tests are discovered from `apps/` and `libs/`. The root pytest configuration adds each member's `src/` directory to the test import path, so tests can import installed package names while running from the repository root.

Keep tests close to the package they cover, in that package's `tests/` directory.
